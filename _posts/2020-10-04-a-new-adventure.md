title: A new adventure
description: Things change, try to keep up

I used to have a blog, which I tended with care for several years. In that blog,
I tried to write down my thoughts about and contributions to a particular, if
vaguely-defined community.

Then, came a few changes and my poor blog became abandoned.

The first blow came when I moved work from South Africa to Europe. It wasn't
only a change of scenery, although I had told myself that when the time came.
Instead, it was actually a change in perspective and how I viewed my role at
work. For years I had been advocating a certain mission; I had been responsible
(if only to myself) for that mission and perspective, and had publicly taken a
stand in promotion thereof. My blog was the outlet for a certain persona which
in my mind others were interested in. In short, I thought I had an audience.

It doesn't really matter whether or not that audience was real, nor how large or
small it actually was. I was doing the writing and I was writing for a certain
reader.

When the change came, I took a small step back from public attitudes, since the
new role I had chosen was no longer one of personal leadership, but
representation of a larger entity, [EGI](https://egi.eu). I still had opinions
of course, and I still wrote for an audience which in my mind was interested in
them. However, I had relinquished that persona which was at the helm and this
change manifested in my author persona as a transition into something more
personal.

That move from representing a public persona to a more personal, indeed more
authentic persona, was the trigger for a long and deep pause in writing.
